# Erlang by example


## Telecom Applications: issues

+ Complex
+ No down time
+ Scalable
+ Maintainable
+ Distributed
+ Time to Market

## Erlang Properties

+ Declarative - Function Programming language, high abstraction level, pattern matching and concise readable programs
+ Concurrency - Elther transparent or explicit Concurrency, lightweight processes and highly Scalable
+ Soft Real-Time - Response times in the order of milliseconds per process garbage collection
+ Robustness - Simple and consistent error recovery, supervision hierarchies and "Program for the correct case"
+ Distribution - Explicit or transparent distribution. Network-aware runtime system
+ Hot code loading - Easily change code in a running system. Enables non-stop operations, Simplifies testing
+ External interfaces - "Port" to the outside world behave as Erlang processes
+ Portability - Erlang runs on any UNIX, UNIX-like, Windows, OSX, Android, VX works, supports heterogenous networks
+ SMP supports - Symmetric multiprocessing support. Takes full advantages of multicore archihectures
